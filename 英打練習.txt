multiplicity for talents: he dabbled in architechture, sculpture, egineering, geology,
hydraulics and the military arts, all with success, and in his spare time doodled
parachutes and flying machines that resembled inventions of the 19th and 20th
centuries.

Olive oil was used for washing the body in the ancient Mediterranean world. in1801,
20 percent of the people in the U.S. were slaves. Slaves under the last emperors of
China wore pigtails so they could be picked out quickly. Dinner guests during the
medieval times in England were expected to bring their own knives to the table.
Traffic engineering was not developed in London, New York or Paris, but rather in 
ancient Rome. The Romans, of course, were noted road builders. The Appian Way,
for example, stretched 350 miles from the Elernal City to Brundisium. In Rome itself
there were actually stop signs and even alternate-side-of-the-street parcking. Until
the 19th century, solid blocks of tea were used as money in Siberia.

	Being rude to telephone operator in Prussia was once a crime. in 1908, a

rude and is only done when pointing to objects or animals, never humans.

	Americans on the average eat 18 acres of pissa every day. Banging your head

not called "The Union Jack" it is actually called "The Union Flag". It's only called the
Union Jack when out at sea on navy ships. You are most likely to get murdered at

	Why are teenagers obessed with zombies and vampire?

	Our current preoccupation with zombies and vampires is easy to explain. They're two
sides of the same coin, addressing our fascination with sex, death and food. They're both
undead, they both feed on us, they both pass on some kind of plague and they can both be
killed with specialist techniques - a stake through the heart or a disembraining. But
they seem to have become polarised. Vampire are the undead of choice for girls, and 
zombies for boys. Vampire are cool, aloof, beautiful, brooding creatures of the night.
Typical moody teenage boys, basically. Zombies are dumb, brutal, ugly and mindlessly
violent. Which makes them also like typical teenage boys, I suppose.

	Zombie stories are life lessons for boys who don't mind thinking about bodies,
but can't cope with emotions. Vampire stories are in many ways sex for the squeamish.
We don't need Raj Persaud to tell us that plunging canines into soft warm necks,
or driving stakes between heaving bosoms, are very basic sexual metaphors.

	There are now even whole sections of bookshops given over to the new genre of
"supernatural  romance". Maybe it was ever thus. Dr Polidori, who wrote the very first
vampire novel, The Vampyr, based his central character very much on his chief patient,
Lord Byron, and the Byronic "mad, bad and dangerous to know" archetype has been at the 
centre of both romantic and blood-sucking fiction ever since. Dracular, Heathcliffe,
Rochester, Darcy and not to mention chief vampire Bill in Channel 4's new series True 
Blood are all cut from the same cloth. Meyer even claims that she based her first 
Twilight book on Pride and Prejudice , although Robert Pattinson, who plays the lead in
the movies version, looks like James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause. Either way,
vampire = sexy rebel.

	No zombie is ever going to be a pinup on some young girl's wall. Just as Pattinson
and all the Darcy-alikes with never find space on any teenage boy's bedroom walls - every
inch will be plastered with revolting posters of zombies. There are no levels of Freudian
undertone to zombies. Like boys, they're not subtle. There's nothing sexual about them,
and nothing sexy either.

	10 Neat Facts About Google Posted by Alex in Blog & Internet, Neatorama Only on 
November 3, 2009 at 3:44 am.
	Sure, everybody knows that Google was created by Stanford Ph.D. students Larry Page
and Sergey Brin who became gazillionaires. But did you know that Google's first storage
device was cobbled together with LEGO? Or that Google's first investor wrote a $100,000 
check even before the company officially existed? Or that it has its own "official" Google 
dog?
	Neatorama presents the Top 10 Neat Facts About Google:

1. Before Google, There Was BackRub
	In 1996, graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin worked on a research project to
understand the link structure of the World Wide Web. They're particularly interested in 
determining the importance of a given web page based on its backlines or how many other
web pages link to it (which later become the concept behind Google's "PageRange" alogorithm).
The project was named BackRub (yes, a play on the word "backline").
	Your logo is upside down : Why is the light source obviously below the image? It looks
quite unnatural ... The logo is simply a scan of my hand, from a flatbed scanner converted 
to black and white. The "back" in the picture is the scanner cover, and the shadows are 
from the scanner light.

2. The Original Google Computer Storage 
	Larry and Sergey needed large amount of disk space to test their PageRank also, but 
the largest hard disks avalible at the time were only 4 GB. So they assembled 10 of these drivers
together.
	While he was an undergrade at Michigan University, Larry had built a programmable
plotter out of LEGO, so it's only natural that he used the colorful bricks to creat Google's first 
computer storage!

3. Google's First Investor
	Sun Microsystem co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim knew a good thing when he saw it.
After talking to Larry and Sergey about Google for 30 minuntes, he whipped out his checkbook
and wrote a check for $100,000, made out to "Google, Inc." Problem was, Google, Inc. hasn't 
existed yet!
	Oh, by the way, the Sun in Sun Microsystem stands for "Stanford University Network."

4. Google Garage 
	Talk about getting lucky tenants. In 1998, Susan Wojcicki rented her garage to two 
Stanford students -you know who they are -for $1,700 a month to help out with the mortgage.
That turnned out to be a life-changing decision for Susan- it got her a key early job at Google 
which translated to a top executive position later on, introduced a future husband to her younger 
sister Anne, and creates a mini cottage industry for the rest of her family. (Photo: Jack Gruber / 
USA Today)
	In 2006, Google bought the house which had become a tourist attraction (the busloads
of people who shows up to take pictures were so annoying  that Google desided not to publish 
the address - though ironically, you can still Google Map it.)

5.Google's First Dog 
	Despite the Internet's obsession with cat, dogs rule Google.. In 1999, a Leonberger breed 
named Yoshka came to work with Google's first VP of Engineering Urs Holxle and become the 
company's "first" dog.(Photo: Google Timeline)
	If you must know, Leonbergers are big dogs with lionesque mane that look really majestic.
They are, however, useless as guard dogs because they're too kind and gentel.

6. Just How Many Servers Does Google Have?
	Good question. Nobody outside the company knows, and Google ain't talk'in. The 
company's famously secretive when it comes to its data centers (Heck, no one even knows for 
sure how many data centers the company has!)
	For example, The Dailies or "Googleville" data center in a small Oregon town, was 
cloaked in secerecy:
	"No one says the 'G'word," said Diane Sherwood, executive director of the Port of Klickitat,
Wash., directly across the river from The Dalles, who is not bound by such agreement."It's a little 
bit like He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in Harry Potter.
	Recently, Google Fellow Jeff Dean gave a revealing talk on large-scale computing systems
in which designed for up to 10 million servers.Skynet. anyone? 

7. "Green" Search
	All those hardware must use a lot of electricity (indeed, Googleville data center is calculate
to require about 103 megawatts of electricity-enough to power 82,000 homes or a city the size of 
Tacoma, Washington), but just how much energy do you use when you perform a Google search?

2019.11.28

	Google calculated that it uses about 1kJ (0.0003 kWh) of energy to answer the average 
search  query. It's so efficient that your PC will likely use more energy in the time it takes to do a
Google search.
	To offset its electricity consumption, Google even installed 1.6MW solar panels on the 
rooftops of the Googleplex . A total of 9,212 solar panels generate 4,475 kWh daily, the equivalent
of about the amount of electricity used by1,000 California homes.

8. Google Trike
	I'm sure you're all familiar with Google Street View and the camera-toppped Google 
Car, but what about all of the interesting places inaccessible to cars? Enter the Google Trike,
which started as a project by Daniel Ratner, a Senior Mechanical Egineer on the Street View 
team:
	"I began thinking about building a bicycle-based Street View system after realizing 
how many interesting places around the world - ranging from historic landmarks to beautiful
trails to shopping districts - aren't accessible by car," says Dan. "When I'm riding the trike, so
many people come up to me and ask where it's off to next or how they can get imagery of 
their favorite spot, so I can't wait to see what our users come up with."

9. I'm Feeling Lucky Costs Google $110 Million a Year
	The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on Google's homepage takes you straight to the first 
web page results. Because it bypasses Google's own search result page, where users are shown 
ads, the button actually costs Google around $110 million a year.
	Why keep it? Google Vice President of Search Product and User Experience Marisa 
said:
	You know Larry and Sergey had the view, and I certainly share it, that it's possible 
just to become too dry, too corporate, too much about making money. And you know what I 
think is really delightful about Google and about the "I'm Feeling Lucky," is that they remind you
that people here have personality and that thay have interests and that there is real people.

10. Googlebot, Revealed At Last!
	In 2005, Ben Rathbone (then at Google'a Hardware Operations) gave us a glimpse of 
humanity's future. I, for one welcome our new Googlebot overlord:
	Then I pondered the question: what does Google do? The grossly simplified answer
that I cmae up with is Google connects the world with the Internet.
	It all snapped into place: the idea of a robot, connecting a world with the Internet, with
the Internet, with wires, that connect to big cabinets of computers. It was not hard then to make 
the leap to representing the internet as a world, or globe, made up of pages.

	The Ugliest Building That's Flip to Print 
	The American Institude of Architects - never a group to remain silent in the face of 
structures that it deems unattractive - has released an index of the ugliest building in New York 
City, part of the local chapter's annual guide to the city's architecture. And guess who is ugliest 
this year? Hint: it's the new headquarters of daily broadsheet newspaper.
	Elsewhere in the new list are not one but two Donald Trump towers, a light blue T.G.I
Friday's restaurant on the Fifth Avenue, a training center for unionized iron workers, a drab Bronx
apartment building and the former headquarters of the defunct Bear Steams.

	Lettis's Wine Rules: Cheese and Vino 
	Red wine and cheese is one of those couplings - like country and Western - that's so 
automatic that few people actually stop to consider if it actually makes sense. Why not, for 
example, country and Southern, since that's where so much of the music comes from anyway?
	Any why red wine with cheese when white wine is so much better with it? Although 
red wine does go well with certain hard cheeses (such as Parmigiano), I find that its tannins 
often get in the way. White wines work better because they're so much more versatile in style,
texture and character. They can be soft and fruity, dry and minerally or sumptuously sweet.
They can pair with goat cheese and blue cheese and stinky cheese, too.
	But I'm convinced that most people drink red wine with cheese for one simple reason:
At the ebd of the meal, it's what they have in their glass. The other night, I was at a friend's house 
for dinner and they pulled out some Camembert to polish off the rest of the wine. Though the
cheese was lovely, it was pretty much squashed by the Zinfandel, whose assertive flavors and 
fairly high alcohol practically bullied the poor Camembert straight off the plate.
	My solution is simple: I serve my cheese at the start of the meal, accompanied by a 
glass of white wine- Sauvignon Blanc, Gruner Veltliner or a Riesling. I know it's not particularly
fashionable - it may even be a bit Midwestern, as one guest once said (without even knowing
that's where I'm from ). But it definitely works as a food and wine pairing. And I'm happy to 
say I've made a few converts. Like my friend Vonnie (Pennsylvania-born), who likes cheese 
first, as well - though she added she 'aspired' to having it after meal. 'I know that it's chic,' she
told me , 'but actually I'd rather have brownie instead.'

	Eating To Live Or Living To Eat?
	Imagine the typical office birthday party. It's after lunch, so everybody is full. Then, in
comes a lusious chocolate confection. The sight, the smell -- even the sound of the world 'cake!'
--stimulate the reward-and-pleasure circuitsof the brain, activating memory centers and salivary 
glands as well.
	Those reactions quickly drown out the subtle signals from the stomach that are saying,
in effect, 'Still digesting down here. Don't send more!' Social cues add pressure and permission 
to indulge. Soon, everybody is having a slice -- or two.
	Scholars have understood the different motives for eating as far back as Socrates, who
counseled, 'Tou shouldst eat to live, not live to eat.' But nowadays, scientists are using sophisticate
brain-imaging technology to understand how the lure of delicious food can overwhelm the body's
built-in  mechanism to regulate hunger and fullness, what's called 'hedonic' versus 'homeostatic'
eating.
	One thingis clear: Obese people  react much more hedonistically to sweet, fat-landen
food in the pleasure and reward circuits of the brain than healthy-weight people do. Simply seeing
pictures of tempting food can light up the pleasure-seeking areas of obese poeple's brains.
	Two conferences this week on obesity are each examining aspects of how appetite works
in the brain and why some people ignore their built-in fullness signals. Scientists hope that 
breakthroughs will lead to ways to retrain people's thinking about food or weight-loss drugs that
can target certain brain areas.

	What's NodeJS and Wht You need to learn it
	Node.js is a framework for writing server-side JavaScript applications. It built on top 
of the V8 JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-block I/O model that makes it 
perfect for data-intensive, real-time application.
	Some of the leading companies in the world use Node in production, like Netflix,
Paypal, Walmart, and Uber.
	Node is often used to build back end service that communicate with client-side 
applications. These applications get and send data through a back end service called an API.
The API server as an interface between different programs so they are able to talk to each 
other. A web app and a mobile app below can leverage the same API to store data, sende 
mails, push notification or initiate workflows on the server.

	Architecture
	Every browser has their own JavaScript engine that converts javascript into code 
that a computer can understand. For example, Microsoft Edge uses Chakra, Firefox uses 
spidermonkey, and chrome uses V8. This explains why JavaScript code can behave 
differently in other browsers.
	Before Node, you could only run LavaScript on the browser. In 2009, being able 
to run JavaScript outside of the browser was finally made possible when Ryan Dahl came 
up with the idea of executing JavaScript outside of the browser. So, he took chromes v8 
engine, which is the fastest JavaScript engine avaliable, and embedded it inside of a C++ 
program and called Node.
	Browsers provide different objects for us to carry out certain task using JavaScript.
With Node, we have objects that allow us to manipulate the file system by creating and 
deleting folders, query databases directly, and create wed servers to serve dat. Both Chrome 
and Node contain the V8 engine, but provide different run time enviroments that give us 
access to different objects/tools to leverage different functions,
	Earlier, I talked about how node is the best for building highly scalabe, data 
intensive applications, Keep in mind that there are other tools and frameworks for building
back-end services such as ASP.NET, Rails, and Django. But, Node comes out on top because
of its asynchronous nature.
	What is I/O ?
	I/O is shorthand for Input or Output and it means accessing outside of your application. 
Once an application has started, it is loaded into the machine's memory. That's what the CPU 
will mostly use for running your program.
	Accessing memory is pretty fast, hence a lot of caching mechanisms simply use RAM 
to store data. However, applications will often need to access the network or read from a text 
file, and these types I/O are by far the slowest types. That's where non-blocking I/O proves it's 
dominance.
	Non-Blocking I/O (Asynchronous)
	Asynchronous, non-blocking servers, like ones made in Node, only use one thread to 
service all requests. This means an instance of Node makes the most out of a single thread. This 
means the server can serve a lot of request without requiring more server hardware; which is
expensive.
	When requests arrive at the server, they are serviced one at a time. However, when the 
code serviced needs to query the DB for example, it sends the callback to a second queue and the 
main request continues to run ; it doest't wait. Now when the DB operation completes and returns,
the corresponding callback is pulled out of the second queue and queued in a third queue where 
they are pending execution. When the engine gets a chance to execute something else, it picks
up a callback from the third queue and executes it.
	Blocking I/O (Synchronous)
	Synchronous blocking operations is how some web servers, like ones in ASP.NET, handle 
IO or network requests by default. If your code reads from a file or the database, your code 
"blocks" everything after it from executing until that first request is finished. In that period, your 
machine is holding onto memory and processing time for a thread that is idle.
	In order to cater other requests while that thread has stalled depends on your softaware.
Most server software spawns more threads to handle the additional requests. This causes more 
memory and processing to be consumed.
	I'm not saying that ASP.NET and other types of frameworkd can't run code asynchrously,
they can , but you have to write more code to make it happen. Node runs asynchronously by 
default without writing extra code. 
	Why Learn NodeJS?
	According to a new study by Carl Joseph and Terence Siganakis, JavaScript was the 
most popular programming language in 2017, and still stands in 1st place today. Developers 
who knows JavaScript are in high demand bt employers because it powers the words most 
popular client-side framework like Angular, React, and Vue. Now, thanks to the perfection of 
Node, JavaScript can be ran on the server side too.
	Think of a webside you use regularly. Chances are, it is responsive, beautiful, and 
quick. This is because it is a frint-end application. Front in applications are composed of HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript. Almost all websites today use JavaScript frameworks to power the 
front-end of their applications, such as data binding, routing, and animations.
	One of the benefits of Node, is that a front-end developer that knows JavaScript can 
be hired on as a full stack developer will higher pay. Teams can build the front-end of an 
application and the back end of the application using one language. It makes more sense to 
use Node on the back end because you'll use JavaScript all the way front to back with same 
conventions, code style, tools, etc.
	Knowing Node makes you more valuable to employers because they are already in
the process of implementing JavaScript on the front-end and backend.
	and that my friend is good news for you(:

	The Most Amazing Things About JK Rowling's Life Story
				Ann DarcyMORE ARTICAELS September 23, 2019
	J.K. Rowling is known all around the world for giving us the magical story of Harry 
Potter. Yet the author was not always on top of the world. Her life story has its fair share of 
struggles.
	Despite her difficults, she managed to come out on top and to become a respected
author who now has more money than the Queen of England. While money does't buy 
happiness, being able to achive your dream does and J.K.Rowling has definitely achive hers 
beyond her wildest dreams. So what is the secret to her success? Perhaps it lies in her life story.
	What is J.K. Rowling's life story?
	J.K. Rowling knew she wanted to be an author from a young age, according to 
Insider. She would write constantly and tell stories to her younger sister, Dianne. However, as 
she got older, she was , like many aspiring authors, encouraged to pursue other things by her 
parents. She went to college study French and graduated in 1986, after which she worked for 
Amnesty International, doing translation work.
	She found her work important but wasn't entirely to her liking. As someone who 
admits to being "one of the most disorganized people in the world" and "the worst 
secretary ever," Rowling would not be an ideal employee for any office. In fact, she admits 
that she would spend her time at work typing up stories when no one was looking and 
meetings would be spent writing down parts of stories or thinking up character names.
	When did she start writing 'Harry Potter'?
	Every Harry Potter fan probably knows this part of the story. In 1990, on a train 
from Manchester to London's King's Cross Station, the idea for Harry Potter popped into 
her head. She would then spend the next five years working on the story. However, in the 
midst of it all, tragedy struck. Rowling's mother died when Rowling was 25. At 26, most 
likely tired of her office job, Rowling moved to Portugal to teach Ebglish. 
	There she would meet and marry a Portuguese journalist named Jorge Arantas.
The couple had a child together, Jassica, named after a favorite author of Rowling's. The 
two of them would breakup shortly after Jassica's birth in July 1993, their relationship 
ending in November. Shortly after the breakup, Rowling headed back to the UK and 
would write the first Harry Potter book on a typewriter in cafes.
	What other struggles play a part in J.K. Rowling's life story?
	Being a single mother is a struggle in and of itself. Yet that is not the only struggle
J.K. Rowling would face at the time. She was also without a job, didn't have much money, 
and was living on welfare. All of these struggles must have overwhelmed her and led to her 
deperssion.
	That's right, J.K. Rowling suffered from depression, and would later be inspired 
to create the Dementors based on her experience with the illness. She would also fase a lot 
of rejection from publishers when first sending out the first Harry Potter book in 1995. Yet 
eventually a publisher named Bloomsbury took a chance on her and published Harry Potter 
and the Philosopher's Stone under the pen name J.K. Rowling, an attempt to hide her gender 
so that boys would read the book. Yet don't worry, despite her struggles she carried on and 
even said in a speach in 2018, that "rock bottom became the solid foundation on which [she] 
rebuilt [her] life."
	So what can be taken away from the admired author's life story? That struggles can 
lead to good outcomes in the end? That rock bottom can indeed be a "solid foundation on

	Hong Kong's political instability means 2020 could be the endgame for 'one country, 
two systems'
				by Albert Cheng 12 Jul,2019
	The current mass protests and rumbles in the financial sector echo the loss of faith 
that preceded the handover. Any threat to Hong Kong's autonomy could set off a series of 
events that lead to the city's demise.
	The eyes of the world are on Hong Kong's extradition bill protests. The millennial-led
demonstrations have matured into a global and unstoppable movement. Karl Marx said history 
repeats itself, "the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce". This is not the first time Hong 
Kong has faced a huge social and political crisis.
	Fifteen years before the handover, Hongkongers realised that their way of life might 
no longer be preserved. Across sectors, there was a loss of faith in the city. The stock market 
plummeted and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to the US dollar crashed. The panic did 
not stop until the Chinese and British governments drafted the Sio-British Joint Declaration. The 
promise of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong" stabilished 
society.
	In theory, there are still 28 years until the pledge of Hong Kong's economic and 
political system remaining "unchanged for 50 years" runs out. However, going by the disquiet 
before the handover, the next big confidence crisis is likely to be in 2033, given that a Legislative 
Council election will be held in 2032. Optimistically, that will be the final countdown to 2047 - 
the endgame.
	In fact, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments do not believe that the promise 
that Hong Kong will "remain unchanged for 50 years" must be kept until 2047 , although there 
are many parctical problems to be solved from land premiums and bank mortgages to 
international treaties. Going by the current political instability, it is very likely that 2020 will be 
the endgame for "one country, two systems."
	Leung Chun-ying was a deeply unpopular chief executive, who undermined Hong 
Kong's core values. Although Leung did not stand for re-election, the increasing interference 
of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong's administration has opened a Pandora's box.
	Cheif Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's government has been a puppet of 
Beijing since she took office. In line with the mission of legislating Article 23, Lam naively 
believed that she could use the Taiwan murder case as a decoy to amend Hong Kong's 
extradition laws, setting off the large-scale anti-extradition movement.
	Lam's inability to lead Hong Kong is evident. Talent and capital have already started
to flee. Goldin Financial rescinding its bid of HK$11.1 billions(US$1.42 billions) for the Kai Tak 
seafront plot is not an isolated incident. Anticipating competition from virtual banks, HSBC 
recently scrapped the minimum balance on savings accounts to stabilise its deposit base. Last 
month, Deutsche Bank cut a large number of jobs in Hong Kong as part of its global 
restructuring. Many multinational corporations are adopting similar strategies.

	Thousands of Hong Kong-born people are returning to Canada
	Moody's rating agency identified Hong Kong's deteriorating economic 
autonomy in the run-up to 2047 as a risk that could result in a lowering of the city's
credit rating in the future. This would inevitably lead to capital outflows. Unlike in 
1997, the exodusof capital and people will not be mild. Hundreds of thousands of 
Hongkongers who have foreign passports or right of abode in other countries 
could leave.
	In the United States, members of Congress have reintorduced the 
bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. Under the act, if China 
fails to ensure Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, the US could revoke Hong 
Kong's high degree of autonomy, the US could revoke Hong Kong's special status 
under American law. If other Western countries follow suit, it would be the end of 
Hong Kong.
	Multinational corporations will move their Asia-Pacific headquarters to 
Singapore. Hong Kong would no longer play the irreplaceable role of interational 
financial centre. "Nylonkong", a ter coined by Time magazine to refer to the 
financial hubs of New York, London and Hong Kong, would be replaced by 
"Nylongpore". Since Singapore is also a bilingual country and an English common 
law jurisdiction, it is only a matter of time before it takes over from Hong Kong as 
the international financial centre in the Asia-Pacific.
	The only way for the Chinese and Hong Kong governments to turn the 
situation around is to face the fact that universal suffrage is necessary. Giving 
Hongkongers true democracy and formulating beneficial socioeconomic policies 
are the solutions to the current crisis. This is the only way to prevent consequences 
will be severe.

	Hong Kong protests: bitter stand-off inside Polytechnic University 
continues with as many as 100 activists still on campus, determined to evade capture 
				by Alvin Lum, Phila Siu 20 Nov, 2019
	No resolution to the bitter stand-off at Hong Kong Polytechnic University 
appeared to be in sight on Tuesday night as 60 to 100 protesters remained on campus,
determined to resist capture and not join the 1,000 who had so far either surrendered 
or been arrested. 
	The city's leader, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, said on Tuesday that she 
hoped the impasse, entering its fourth day by Wednesday, could be resolved peacefully,
with those injured and aged under 18 handled in a humane manner.
	She pledged that the minnors would not be arrested but would only have their 
names recorded for the time being.
	 Since Sunday evening, police have surrounded the campus following a day of 
extremely violent clashes which the force declared to be a riot.
	On Monday, hard core radicals went on a rampage all over Kowloon, wreaking 
havoc by blocking roads and setting off petrol bombs in a bid to distract the police and 
thin out their ranks at the campus.
	Stretched of Nathan Road were damaged bt bricks, barricades and fire, with 
Tsim, Jordan, Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok witnessing some of the night's most chaotic 
scenes that continued well into the early hours of Tuesday.
	Police fired 1,456 rounds of tear gas, 1,301 rubber bullets, 325 beanbag rounds
and 265 sponge grenades on Monday.

	More than 200 people were arrested at Pitt Street, Mong Kok on Monday 
night and will be charged for rioting, the largest number of people prosecuted  for the 
offence at the same time, according to police scources. They are expected to appear 
in West Kowloon Magistracy on Wednesday morning.
	Tuesday night offered a respite of sorts for police, with only about 100 protesters 
active in Mong Kok. The force maintained a light presence and nothing more came of the 
stand-off.
	At Polytechnic University's stand-off, about 800 protesters, including 300 aged 
under 18, had surrendered by Tuesday night while another 500 were arrested.
	Most were arrested for rioting offences which could result in a maximum penalty 
of 10 years in jail.
	'More than 200 radicals' to be charged for rioting in Yau Ma Tei
	The number of arrests on Monday was the highest for a single day since the 
protests, sparked in early June by opposition to an extradition bill and which snowballed 
into a wider anti-government movement.
	 Carrie Lam said the record high showed the government and police force were 
capable of handling the situation, dismissing suggestions that the People's Liberation 
Army could be called upon to restore order to the city.
	Asked about continuing speculation Sunday's district council elections could 
be postponed, Lam renewed her appeal for protesters to call a half to their violent tactics 
so that "just and fair" elections could be staged.
	Hundreds were evacuated overnight from inside the campus after 75 secondary 
school heads and teachers, along with political and legal heavyweights, persuaded them 
after coordinating with police.
	A few groups, numbering about a dozen each, also emerged on Tuesday with 
some suffering from hypothermia and leg injuries. In the evening, another 12 or so came 
out accompanied by opposition lawmarker Ted Hui Chi- fung, who was allowed to go home 
without being arrested.
	A group of more than 20 volunteer first aiders, some of whom had been inside 
the campus since at least Sunday, at 8pm announced they had performed their duties and 
would leave.
	"We want our safety to be guaranteed when we leave the school," a representative 
said, adding the number of protesters remaining had gone down and food and water were 
running low.
	A total of 280 injured protesters from PolyU were sent to 12 public hospitals in 
batches on Tuesday afternoon, a spokesman fron the Hospital Authority said.
	On Tuesday night, newly-minted Police Commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung 
who took over the post on Monday made an appearance outside the campus to boost 
the morale of his men out in force for three days. 
	Auxiliary Bishop of Hong Kong Joseph Ha Chi-shing also visited the campus as 
he wanted to tell the young people inside to believe in hope, as he had heard they were 
ready to die defending the school.

	"I hope they can understand not everything can be solved in a day. At the 
moment I am here to listen to what [the protesters] want, I am not sure it is so easy to 
convince them to leave," he said.
	Over the course of the past three day, desperate but defiant protesters had 
tried various methods to break out from the campus, with two groups making a faied bid 
late on Tuesday night and were soon arrested by police.
	In the early hours of Tuesday, several climbed down a manhole leading to an 
underground tunnel, only to resurface through another drain also on campus.
	"It was disgusting [down there]," a masked man said. "We resorted to doing 
this because we did not know how else to seek help from the outside world."
	On Monday night, dozens of escapees abseiled seven metres from a campus 
footbridge onto a highway and were picked up by waiting motorcycles, resulting in 37 
arrests according to police but videos of this stunt went viral, with supporters cheering 
them on.

	New police chief faces challenge of ending unrest and winning trust
	By Tuesday evening, a Post reporter observed at least three teams still searching 
for an elusive exit from campus. One group of 20 had attempted to flee from nearby roads 
in the early afternoon, but their mission was aborted when police were seen patrolling 
near a flyover.
	Some defiant protesters said they would fight until they got arrested.
	"We will not turn ourselves in - that's conceding default," said Eric, 18, a student 
who had been on campus for three days. "We will just hide or maybe lock ourselves in a 
room."
	He said he had only slept for five hours during the past three days as he tried to 
find a way out or stay alert to any advance from police.
	Protesters estimated that about 60 to 100 of their peers remained on campus, 
with many of those still there not PolyU students or possibly having never attended any 
university.
	Among them was radical protester Sum Yiu, 25, who finished school when he 
was 19 and worked in various driving jobs since.
	"We just wanted to protect the students, but there are no students for us to 
protect," Yiu said. "We can't even protect ourselves.
	Police investigate alleged attect on Albert Ho
	He said he understood why some chose to go.
	"We are outnumbered and we can only hope police will not storm in," he said.
	At about 10.45 pm, a final group of volunteer first aid workers were led to a police 
cordon by the Science Museum to leave PolyU, accompanied by a lawyer. While the first aid 
workers were being searched by riot police, a small group of protesters attempted to escape,
making a break for it by climbing over a fence. However, they were spotted and more than 
10 were arrested.
	Speaking ahead of her weekly Executive Council meeting ealier on Tuesday, Lam 
said she had laid out two principles with police for handling the stand-off: that they were to 
resolve the incident peacefully and treat injured or underage protesters in a humanitarian 
manner.
	Describing the arrangement as exceptional, she said those under 18 had been 
allowed to go home after their personal details were recorded by police, with the force 
reserving the right to arrest them later.
	More than 8,000 petrol bombs primed for Hong Kong streets 'found at Chinese 
University'
	Lam also condemned Chinese University being turned into a "weapons factory", 
as police later revealed during their daily briefing that more than 3,000 unused petrol bombs
had been found on the Sha Tin campus on Monday, while 100 litres of concentrated acid 
was missing from the laboratories. A total of over 8000 petrol bombs had been founded on 
the campus, a source told the Post.
	At the same briefing, Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung adressed allegations
of brutality when subding protesters.
	"They intentionally put up struggle and resistance no matter, to make room and create
time for others to rescue them," Kong siad. "In subduing these kinds of rioters, we have to do it 
quickly and with appropriate force."
	On Wednesday, defiant protesters are planning to block traffic and trains to revive their 
weekday campaign of chaos.

	Hong Kong protests: parents searching for children among PolyU radical protesters 
get caught in police lockdown
	Two fathers say they found their teenage sons, but could not get away from campus.
	Hundreds of radicals and supporters hold out overnight before surrendering on 
Tuesday. 
				by Sum Lok-kei, Chris Lau, Alvin Lum 19 Nov,2019
	The siege of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University by police trapped not only radical 
protesters, but also social workers, first-aid volunteers and parents who said they were there to 
get their children out.
	John, 58, stood with his son near the main entrance of the university in Hung Hom on 
Monday night, hoping to find a way out, after their earlier getaway attempt failed.
	Another father, Li, 45, mulled his next move after his plan to take his teenage son home 
also fell flat.
	It is not known how the fathers and their sons fared on Tuesday, when only a few dozen 
people were believed to be still inside the campu, a stark contrast to the scenes of violent clashes 
between police and hundreds of masked radicals earlier.
	A police lockdown led to hundreds eventually leaving overnight on Monday and on 
Tuesday. As of 3pm on Tuesday, police said, about 1,100 people from the campus and nearby had
been arrested or, if they were minors, had their particulars registered before they were allowed 
to go home. 
	About 600 left voluntarily, including 200 minors. The adults included 47 PolyU teaching 
and administrative staff.
	John said he arrived on Sunday to look for his 18-year-old son, a PolyU student. Then the 
situation took a turn for the worse. 
	Radicals at PolyU rained petrol bombs on police and set an armoured vehicle of the force
ablaze. Police responded with volleys of tear gas, then cut off all campus exits and ordered those 
inside to leave.
	Of those who emerged, only accerdited journalists were not arrested.

	'Cold and hungry' radicals surrender as Lam tells police to let minors go home
	John and his son were still inside on Monday night when he said: "They said on Sunday we 
could leave, but we saw people ahead being arrested, no matter whether they were first aiders or 
kids. There were no options or room for negotiation."
	His son was thankful that his father had looked for him and found him, despite the intense 
clashes going on.
	"I am grateful, he has also come to some protests with me," the teenager said.
	Still inside early on Tuesday, John said all he wanted was for the two of them to get home 
safely.
	Li said his 15-year-old son went to the university on Saturday to providefirst aid. The father 
arrived to search for the boy the next day.
	"I did not do anything, I just came to get my kid," Li said. "I don't want to be arrested."
	The father and son found each other at 7pm on Sunday, by which police had already put the
campus on lockdown.
	Thousands hit Hong Kong streets in bid to end police campus siege 
	"I don't know who to turn to, to get out," Li said on Tuesday morning.
	It is not known what happened to John, Li and their sons afterwards.
	Social workers and volunteer first aiders were among those still inside the campus on Tuesday 
morning. Some first-aiders feared they would be arrested for rioting if they left the police checkpoints.
	A female social worker said she was on campus since Thursday, counselling youngsters among 
the protesters.
	The police decision to contain the radicals and their supporters within the campus had an 
emotional inpact on many, she said.
	They feared that they would be shot if they obeyed the police order to leave, she said, yet they 
were also worried that if they remained, there would bo no reporters present to witness what happended 
to them.
	Despite the threat of being arrested for rioting, the social worker said she did not regret going 
there.
	"We are not  the ones who have paid the heaviest price," she said. "I don't want to be on the 
sidelines."
	Anri-mask law ruling from Hong Kong judges slammed by Beijing
	Pak, a 20-year-old who described himself as a first-aider,said he was struggling to decide whether 
to leave. "I came to save people," he said.
	He said many first-aiders were considering surrendering because they did not want to risk 
harming police officers if they needed to use force to get out.
	In a daring episode on Monday night, dozens of people found a spot at the edge of the campus
and abseiled down a footbridge to a highway and took off in getaway vehicles.
	But many others remained on campus overnight, but on Tuesday mornig, some of those who 
decided to leave said they were cold and hungry.
	"We only had biscuits," a boy said. "We haven't eaten since yesterday afternoon."
	Rain Lau, 28, said some volunteers managed to cook some noodles on Monday night, but the 
situation had deteriorated and there was only packaged food.
	Lau said she went to the PolyU campus for a "safeguard children rally" on Saturday and ended
up being trapped there.
	She said she was too tired to stay much longer, even if it meant being arrested.
	"Lawyers have also told us we won't be charged immediately and can probably be bailed," she 
said. 
	Nathan, 18, was in group that left the campus on Tuesday morning, prepared to be arrested. 
His mother reported him to his school principal.

	He said he and others tried several times throughout Monday to break through the police line 
and escape, but each time they failed and people were arrested.
	"Each time we lost 50, and then another 100, and the chance of walking out free slipped away,"
he said.
	Among the principals who spent Monday night on campus trying to persuade their students to 
leave was Joshua Lau Chi-kin, who said many refused to go because they did not want to leave others 
behind. 
	He spent three hours talking to two students, aged 15 and 16, advising them to leave on Tuesday 
morning.
	"Thy felt their comrades were still there," he said. "I could only tell them I was worried about them."
	On Tuesday afternoon, nine parents worried about their children were seen holding cardboard 
signs at the police cordon outside New Mandarin Plaza shopping centre in Tsim Sha Tsui.
	One poster said: "Always support and love you. Just want you to be safe!"
	The mother of a fourth-year Universiy of Hong Kong student said: "He is very peace-loving and is 
not a protester. He only went into the campus to support the movement. He is trapped inside with his 
girlfriend.
	"He wants to come out, but he said he was afraid to come out, most likely because the 
government will label him a rioter."
	Another mother, surname Lau, said her 20-year-old son was inside the campus. "As parents, we 
feel very helpless," she said.
	Another mother said: "As a parents, we only wish that they come out safely, and hope they won't
be treated unfairly."

	Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone
	Chapter 1 The Boy Who Lived
	Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly 
normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or 
mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsence.
	Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy
man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin blonde and
had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent  so much of her time 
craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in 
their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

2019/12/07

	The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was 
that somebody would discovery it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't 
have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible 
to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The 
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another 
good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
	When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing 
about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over 
the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped 
away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
None of them notice a large, tawny owl fluffer past the window.
	At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to 
kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having tantrum and through his cereal at the walls.
	"Little tyke," chortled Mr.Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number 
four's drive.
	It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading 
a map. For a second, Mr Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look 
again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a maps or a signs. 
Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought 
of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
	But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual 
morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to ba a lot of strangely dressed people
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny cloths -- the getups you saw 
on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering 
wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly 
together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be 
older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that 
this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for somrthing ... yes, that would 
be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind 
back on drills.
	Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he 
might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swooping past in 
daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl-free morning.
He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was 
in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy 
himself a bun from the bakery.
	He'd forgotten all about the people in cloacks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's.
He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were 
whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin, It was on his way back past them, 
clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that ha caught a few words of what they were saying.
	"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard -- "
	"-- yes, their son, Harry--"
	Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to 
say something to them, but thought better of it.
	He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him,
seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the
receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an 
unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think 
of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been 
Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her 
sister. He blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that ... but all the same, those people in cloaks ...
	He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five 
o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
	"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. 
Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked 
to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in squeaky voice that made 
passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who 
has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!"

2019/12/08

	And the old man hugged Mr. Dursely around the middle and walked off.
	Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought
he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, 
hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.
	As he pulled into driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and inprove his mood -- was the 
tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it 
had the same marking around its eyes.
	"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly.
	The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley 
wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to 
mention anything to his wife.
	Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's
problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learn a new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act 
normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in the time to catch the last 
report on the evening news:  
	"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been 
behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight,
there have been hundreds of sighting of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are 
unable to explain why owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern. "The newscater allowed 
himself a grin. "Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more 
showers of owls tonight, Jim?"
	"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have 
been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell 
me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps
 people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet 
night tonight. "
	Mr. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say 
something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you have't heard from your sister 
lately, have you? "
	As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended 
she did't have a sister.
	"No," she said sharply. "Why?"
	"Funny stuff on the news, "Mr. Dursley mumbled. "Owls ... shooting stars ... and there were a lot 
of funny-looking people in the town today ..."
	"So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley.
	"Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to do with ... you know ... her crowd."
	Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell 
her he'd heard the name "Potter." He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "
Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?"
	"I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
	"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?"
	"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me."
	"Oh, yes," said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite agree."
	He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was 
in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The 
cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.

	Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got 
out that they were related to a pair of --well, he didn't think he could bear it.
	The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it 
all over in his mind. His last, conforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were 
involved, there was no reason for them them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very 
well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind ... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could
get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them.
	How very wrong he was.
	Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was 
showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner 
of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two 
owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
	A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently 
you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.
	Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging
by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing 
long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were 
light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as 
though it had been broken at least twice. The man's name was Albus Dumbledore.
	Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything 
from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something.
But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was 
still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to 
amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, "I should have known."
	He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket, it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter.
He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. 
He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darckness. Twelve timed he clicked the Put-Outer, until 
the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see 
anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his 
cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He 
didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.
	"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."
	He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe
-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around
its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She 
looked distinctly ruffled.
	"How did you know it was me?" she asked.
	"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."
	"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said Professor McGonagall.
	"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties
on my way here."
	Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
	"Oh yes, I've celebrating, all right," she said impatiently. "You'd think they'd be a bit more careful,
but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news." She jerked her 
head back at the Dursley's dark living-room window. "I heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars ... well,
they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll
bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."
	"You can't blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious little to celebrate for 
eleven years."
	"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that's no reason to lose our heads. People
are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, 
swapping rumors."
	She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell 
her something, but he didn't, so she went on. "A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who
seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, 
Dumbledore?"
	"It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for
a lemon drop?"
	"A what?"
	"A lemond drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of."
	"No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the 
moment for a lemon drops. "As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone--"
	"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this '
You-Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his 
proper name: Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two 
lemon drops, semmed not to notice. "It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have
never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name."
