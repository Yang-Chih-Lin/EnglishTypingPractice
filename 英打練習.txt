	The Last Supper (1495). But he's almost equally famous for his astonishing
multiplicity for talents: he dabbled in architechture, sculpture, egineering, geology,
hydraulics and the military arts, all with success, and in his spare time doodled
parachutes and flying machines that resembled inventions of the 19th and 20th
centuries.

Olive oil was used for washing the body in the ancient Mediterranean world. in1801,
20 percent of the people in the U.S. were slaves. Slaves under the last emperors of
China wore pigtails so they could be picked out quickly. Dinner guests during the
medieval times in England were expected to bring their own knives to the table.
Traffic engineering was not developed in London, New York or Paris, but rather in 
ancient Rome. The Romans, of course, were noted road builders. The Appian Way,
for example, stretched 350 miles from the Elernal City to Brundisium. In Rome itself
there were actually stop signs and even alternate-side-of-the-street parcking. Until
the 19th century, solid blocks of tea were used as money in Siberia.

	Being rude to telephone operator in Prussia was once a crime. in 1908, a 
respected citizen was reprimanded by the government after becoming exasperated
with an operator and saying "My dear girl"! In Thailand, the left hand is considered
unclean, so you should not eat with it. Also, pointing with one finger is considered
rude and is only done when pointing to objects or animals, never humans.

	Americans on the average eat 18 acres of pissa every day. Banging your head
against a wall uses 150 calories an hour. Contrary to popular belief, the British flag is
not called "The Union Jack" it is actually called "The Union Flag". It's only called the
Union Jack when out at sea on navy ships. You are most likely to get murdered at

	Why are teenagers obessed with zombies and vampire?

	Our current preoccupation with zombies and vampires is easy to explain. They're two
sides of the same coin, addressing our fascination with sex, death and food. They're both
undead, they both feed on us, they both pass on some kind of plague and they can both be
killed with specialist techniques - a stake through the heart or a disembraining. But
they seem to have become polarised. Vampire are the undead of choice for girls, and 
zombies for boys. Vampire are cool, aloof, beautiful, brooding creatures of the night.
Typical moody teenage boys, basically. Zombies are dumb, brutal, ugly and mindlessly
violent. Which makes them also like typical teenage boys, I suppose.

	Zombie stories are life lessons for boys who don't mind thinking about bodies,
but can't cope with emotions. Vampire stories are in many ways sex for the squeamish.
We don't need Raj Persaud to tell us that plunging canines into soft warm necks,
or driving stakes between heaving bosoms, are very basic sexual metaphors.

	There are now even whole sections of bookshops given over to the new genre of
"supernatural  romance". Maybe it was ever thus. Dr Polidori, who wrote the very first
vampire novel, The Vampyr, based his central character very much on his chief patient,
Lord Byron, and the Byronic "mad, bad and dangerous to know" archetype has been at the 
centre of both romantic and blood-sucking fiction ever since. Dracular, Heathcliffe,
Rochester, Darcy and not to mention chief vampire Bill in Channel 4's new series True 
Blood are all cut from the same cloth. Meyer even claims that she based her first 
Twilight book on Pride and Prejudice , although Robert Pattinson, who plays the lead in
the movies version, looks like James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause. Either way,
vampire = sexy rebel.

	No zombie is ever going to be a pinup on some young girl's wall. Just as Pattinson
and all the Darcy-alikes with never find space on any teenage boy's bedroom walls - every
inch will be plastered with revolting posters of zombies. There are no levels of Freudian
undertone to zombies. Like boys, they're not subtle. There's nothing sexual about them,
and nothing sexy either.

	10 Neat Facts About Google Posted by Alex in Blog & Internet, Neatorama Only on 
November 3, 2009 at 3:44 am.
	Sure, everybody knows that Google was created by Stanford Ph.D. students Larry Page
and Sergey Brin who became gazillionaires. But did you know that Google's first storage
device was cobbled together with LEGO? Or that Google's first investor wrote a $100,000 
check even before the company officially existed? Or that it has its own "official" Google 
dog?
	Neatorama presents the Top 10 Neat Facts About Google:

1. Before Google, There Was BackRub
	In 1996, graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin worked on a research project to
understand the link structure of the World Wide Web. They're particularly interested in 
determining the importance of a given web page based on its backlines or how many other
web pages link to it (which later become the concept behind Google's "PageRange" alogorithm).
The project was named BackRub (yes, a play on the word "backline").
	Your logo is upside down : Why is the light source obviously below the image? It looks
quite unnatural ... The logo is simply a scan of my hand, from a flatbed scanner converted 
to black and white. The "back" in the picture is the scanner cover, and the shadows are 
from the scanner light.

2. The Original Google Computer Storage 
	Larry and Sergey needed large amount of disk space to test their PageRank also, but 
the largest hard disks avalible at the time were only 4 GB. So they assembled 10 of these drivers
together.
	While he was an undergrade at Michigan University, Larry had built a programmable
plotter out of LEGO, so it's only natural that he used the colorful bricks to creat Google's first 
computer storage!

3. Google's First Investor
	Sun Microsystem co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim knew a good thing when he saw it.
After talking to Larry and Sergey about Google for 30 minuntes, he whipped out his checkbook
and wrote a check for $100,000, made out to "Google, Inc." Problem was, Google, Inc. hasn't 
existed yet!
	Oh, by the way, the Sun in Sun Microsystem stands for "Stanford University Network."

4. Google Garage 
	Talk about getting lucky tenants. In 1998, Susan Wojcicki rented her garage to two 
Stanford students -you know who they are -for $1,700 a month to help out with the mortgage.
That turnned out to be a life-changing decision for Susan- it got her a key early job at Google 
which translated to a top executive position later on, introduced a future husband to her younger 
sister Anne, and creates a mini cottage industry for the rest of her family. (Photo: Jack Gruber / 
USA Today)
	In 2006, Google bought the house which had become a tourist attraction (the busloads
of people who shows up to take pictures were so annoying  that Google desided not to publish 
the address - though ironically, you can still Google Map it.)

5.Google's First Dog 
	Despite the Internet's obsession with cat, dogs rule Google.. In 1999, a Leonberger breed 
named Yoshka came to work with Google's first VP of Engineering Urs Holxle and become the 
company's "first" dog.(Photo: Google Timeline)
	If you must know, Leonbergers are big dogs with lionesque mane that look really majestic.
They are, however, useless as guard dogs because they're too kind and gentel.

6. Just How Many Servers Does Google Have?
	Good question. Nobody outside the company knows, and Google ain't talk'in. The 
company's famously secretive when it comes to its data centers (Heck, no one even knows for 
sure how many data centers the company has!)
	For example, The Dailies or "Googleville" data center in a small Oregon town, was 
cloaked in secerecy:
	"No one says the 'G'word," said Diane Sherwood, executive director of the Port of Klickitat,
Wash., directly across the river from The Dalles, who is not bound by such agreement."It's a little 
bit like He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in Harry Potter.
	Recently, Google Fellow Jeff Dean gave a revealing talk on large-scale computing systems
in which designed for up to 10 million servers.Skynet. anyone? 

7. "Green" Search
	All those hardware must use a lot of electricity (indeed, Googleville data center is calculate
to require about 103 megawatts of electricity-enough to power 82,000 homes or a city the size of 
Tacoma, Washington), but just how much energy do you use when you perform a Google search?

2019.11.28

	Google calculated that it uses about 1kJ (0.0003 kWh) of energy to answer the average 
search  query. It's so efficient that your PC will likely use more energy in the time it takes to do a
Google search.
	To offset its electricity consumption, Google even installed 1.6MW solar panels on the 
rooftops of the Googleplex . A total of 9,212 solar panels generate 4,475 kWh daily, the equivalent
of about the amount of electricity used by1,000 California homes.

8. Google Trike
	I'm sure you're all familiar with Google Street View and the camera-toppped Google 
Car, but what about all of the interesting places inaccessible to cars? Enter the Google Trike,
which started as a project by Daniel Ratner, a Senior Mechanical Egineer on the Street View 
team:
	"I began thinking about building a bicycle-based Street View system after realizing 
how many interesting places around the world - ranging from historic landmarks to beautiful
trails to shopping districts - aren't accessible by car," says Dan. "When I'm riding the trike, so
many people come up to me and ask where it's off to next or how they can get imagery of 
their favorite spot, so I can't wait to see what our users come up with."

9. I'm Feeling Lucky Costs Google $110 Million a Year
	The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on Google's homepage takes you straight to the first 
web page results. Because it bypasses Google's own search result page, where users are shown 
ads, the button actually costs Google around $110 million a year.
	Why keep it? Google Vice President of Search Product and User Experience Marisa 
said:
	You know Larry and Sergey had the view, and I certainly share it, that it's possible 
just to become too dry, too corporate, too much about making money. And you know what I 
think is really delightful about Google and about the "I'm Feeling Lucky," is that they remind you
that people here have personality and that thay have interests and that there is real people.

10. Googlebot, Revealed At Last!
	In 2005, Ben Rathbone (then at Google'a Hardware Operations) gave us a glimpse of 
humanity's future. I, for one welcome our new Googlebot overlord:
	Then I pondered the question: what does Google do? The grossly simplified answer
that I cmae up with is Google connects the world with the Internet.
	It all snapped into place: the idea of a robot, connecting a world with the Internet, with
the Internet, with wires, that connect to big cabinets of computers. It was not hard then to make 
the leap to representing the internet as a world, or globe, made up of pages.

	The Ugliest Building That's Flip to Print 
	The American Institude of Architects - never a group to remain silent in the face of 
structures that it deems unattractive - has released an index of the ugliest building in New York 
City, part of the local chapter's annual guide to the city's architecture. And guess who is ugliest 
this year? Hint: it's the new headquarters of daily broadsheet newspaper.
	Elsewhere in the new list are not one but two Donald Trump towers, a light blue T.G.I
Friday's restaurant on the Fifth Avenue, a training center for unionized iron workers, a drab Bronx
apartment building and the former headquarters of the defunct Bear Steams.

	Lettis's Wine Rules: Cheese and Vino 
	Red wine and cheese is one of those couplings - like country and Western - that's so 
automatic that few people actually stop to consider if it actually makes sense. Why not, for 
example, country and Southern, since that's where so much of the music comes from anyway?
	Any why red wine with cheese when white wine is so much better with it? Although 
red wine does go well with certain hard cheeses (such as Parmigiano), I find that its tannins 
often get in the way. White wines work better because they're so much more versatile in style,
texture and character. They can be soft and fruity, dry and minerally or sumptuously sweet.
They can pair with goat cheese and blue cheese and stinky cheese, too.
	But I'm convinced that most people drink red wine with cheese for one simple reason:
At the ebd of the meal, it's what they have in their glass. The other night, I was at a friend's house 
for dinner and they pulled out some Camembert to polish off the rest of the wine. Though the
cheese was lovely, it was pretty much squashed by the Zinfandel, whose assertive flavors and 
fairly high alcohol practically bullied the poor Camembert straight off the plate.
	My solution is simple: I serve my cheese at the start of the meal, accompanied by a 
glass of white wine- Sauvignon Blanc, Gruner Veltliner or a Riesling. I know it's not particularly
fashionable - it may even be a bit Midwestern, as one guest once said (without even knowing
that's where I'm from ). But it definitely works as a food and wine pairing. And I'm happy to 
say I've made a few converts. Like my friend Vonnie (Pennsylvania-born), who likes cheese 
first, as well - though she added she 'aspired' to having it after meal. 'I know that it's chic,' she
told me , 'but actually I'd rather have brownie instead.'

	Eating To Live Or Living To Eat?
	Imagine the typical office birthday party. It's after lunch, so everybody is full. Then, in
comes a lusious chocolate confection. The sight, the smell -- even the sound of the world 'cake!'
--stimulate the reward-and-pleasure circuitsof the brain, activating memory centers and salivary 
glands as well.
	Those reactions quickly drown out the subtle signals from the stomach that are saying,
in effect, 'Still digesting down here. Don't send more!' Social cues add pressure and permission 
to indulge. Soon, everybody is having a slice -- or two.
	Scholars have understood the different motives for eating as far back as Socrates, who
counseled, 'Tou shouldst eat to live, not live to eat.' But nowadays, scientists are using sophisticate
brain-imaging technology to understand how the lure of delicious food can overwhelm the body's
built-in  mechanism to regulate hunger and fullness, what's called 'hedonic' versus 'homeostatic'
eating.
	One thingis clear: Obese people  react much more hedonistically to sweet, fat-landen
food in the pleasure and reward circuits of the brain than healthy-weight people do. Simply seeing
pictures of tempting food can light up the pleasure-seeking areas of obese poeple's brains.
	Two conferences this week on obesity are each examining aspects of how appetite works
in the brain and why some people ignore their built-in fullness signals. Scientists hope that 
breakthroughs will lead to ways to retrain people's thinking about food or weight-loss drugs that
can target certain brain areas.

	What's NodeJS and Wht You need to learn it
	Node.js is a framework for writing server-side JavaScript applications. It built on top 
of the V8 JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-block I/O model that makes it 
perfect for data-intensive, real-time application.
	Some of the leading companies in the world use Node in production, like Netflix,
Paypal, Walmart, and Uber.
	Node is often used to build back end service that communicate with client-side 
applications. These applications get and send data through a back end service called an API.
The API server as an interface between different programs so they are able to talk to each 
other. A web app and a mobile app below can leverage the same API to store data, sende 
mails, push notification or initiate workflows on the server.

	Architecture
	Every browser has their own JavaScript engine that converts javascript into code 
that a computer can understand. For example, Microsoft Edge uses Chakra, Firefox uses 
spidermonkey, and chrome uses V8. This explains why JavaScript code can behave 
differently in other browsers.
	Before Node, you could only run LavaScript on the browser. In 2009, being able 
to run JavaScript outside of the browser was finally made possible when Ryan Dahl came 
up with the idea of executing JavaScript outside of the browser. So, he took chromes v8 
engine, which is the fastest JavaScript engine avaliable, and embedded it inside of a C++ 
program and called Node.
	Browsers provide different objects for us to carry out certain task using JavaScript.
With Node, we have objects that allow us to manipulate the file system by creating and 
deleting folders, query databases directly, and create wed servers to serve dat. Both Chrome 
and Node contain the V8 engine, but provide different run time enviroments that give us 
access to different objects/tools to leverage different functions,
	Earlier, I talked about how node is the best for building highly scalabe, data 
intensive applications, Keep in mind that there are other tools and frameworks for building
back-end services such as ASP.NET, Rails, and Django. But, Node comes out on top because
of its asynchronous nature.
	What is I/O ?
	I/O is shorthand for Input or Output and it means accessing outside of your application. 
Once an application has started, it is loaded into the machine's memory. That's what the CPU 
will mostly use for running your program.
	Accessing memory is pretty fast, hence a lot of caching mechanisms simply use RAM 
to store data. However, applications will often need to access the network or read from a text 
file, and these types I/O are by far the slowest types. That's where non-blocking I/O proves it's 
dominance.
	Non-Blocking I/O (Asynchronous)
	Asynchronous, non-blocking servers, like ones made in Node, only use one thread to 
service all requests. This means an instance of Node makes the most out of a single thread. This 
means the server can serve a lot of request without requiring more server hardware; which is
expensive.
	When requests arrive at the server, they are serviced one at a time. However, when the 
code serviced needs to query the DB for example, it sends the callback to a second queue and the 
main request continues to run ; it doest't wait. Now when the DB operation completes and returns,
the corresponding callback is pulled out of the second queue and queued in a third queue where 
they are pending execution. When the engine gets a chance to execute something else, it picks
up a callback from the third queue and executes it.
	Blocking I/O (Synchronous)
	Synchronous blocking operations is how some web servers, like ones in ASP.NET, handle 
IO or network requests by default. If your code reads from a file or the database, your code 
"blocks" everything after it from executing until that first request is finished. In that period, your 
machine is holding onto memory and processing time for a thread that is idle.
	In order to cater other requests while that thread has stalled depends on your softaware.
Most server software spawns more threads to handle the additional requests. This causes more 
memory and processing to be consumed.
	I'm not saying that ASP.NET and other types of frameworkd can't run code asynchrously,
they can , but you have to write more code to make it happen. Node runs asynchronously by 
default without writing extra code. 
	Why Learn NodeJS?
	According to a new study by Carl Joseph and Terence Siganakis, JavaScript was the 
most popular programming language in 2017, and still stands in 1st place today. Developers 
who knows JavaScript are in high demand bt employers because it powers the words most 
popular client-side framework like Angular, React, and Vue. Now, thanks to the perfection of 
Node, JavaScript can be ran on the server side too.
	Think of a webside you use regularly. Chances are, it is responsive, beautiful, and 
quick. This is because it is a frint-end application. Front in applications are composed of HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript. Almost all websites today use JavaScript frameworks to power the 
front-end of their applications, such as data binding, routing, and animations.
	One of the benefits of Node, is that a front-end developer that knows JavaScript can 
be hired on as a full stack developer will higher pay. Teams can build the front-end of an 
application and the back end of the application using one language. It makes more sense to 
use Node on the back end because you'll use JavaScript all the way front to back with same 
conventions, code style, tools, etc.
	Knowing Node makes you more valuable to employers because they are already in
the process of implementing JavaScript on the front-end and backend.
	and that my friend is good news for you(:
